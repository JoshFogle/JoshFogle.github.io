<p>I am currently a full-time student at Mount Aloysius College. During the summer of 2021, I worked at Shop 'N Save as a Stocker. This job helped me develop some important skills including organization, time management, adaptability, and communication skills. These skills will be important in helping me succeed within the information technology field which is my ultimate goal after getting my bachelor's degree. My dream job in the field would be a Computer Systems Administrator. I chose this major since I've always enjoyed working with technology, understanding how it works, and ways to fix different issues.</p>
